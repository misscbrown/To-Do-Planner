# To-Do-Planner
A daily planner

Inspiration

I created this as a practise project, to work on my local storage understanding as well as bootstrap. I wanted to create a tool to help people such as small business owners to plan their day. 

Further development

Some more Javascript could be incorporated to make the planner more interactive, change the theme colours at the users request and make it shareable so other members of staff can input items into the planner. The colours that show past, present and future are not showing up in the body of the input fields, only in the time boxes.
